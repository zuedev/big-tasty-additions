# Big Tasty Additions

> Season your Minecraft with this mod!

This mod aims to expand on a bunch of vanilla features to make them needlessly complex. From having to slice, dice, and fry potatoes to make tater tots, to needing to polish and buff your armor to keep it from breaking, this mod aims to make Minecraft a little more tedious... In a fun way!
